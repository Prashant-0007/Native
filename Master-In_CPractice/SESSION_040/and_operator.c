/* 
    proposition = a declarative statement in English which is True or False 
                    but not both. 
    Let p be a proposition. 
    Let q be a proposition. 

    p AND q is also a proposition. 

    Question? 
    What is the truth value of p AND q 
    Answer: 
    Depends on  the truth value of p and the 
    truth value of q 

    p AND q is a proposition whose truth value 
    is true if both p and q are simultaneously true, 
    false otherwise.
